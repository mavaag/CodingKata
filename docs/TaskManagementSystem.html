**Title:** Task Management System

**Description:** Create a task management system that allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. The system will consist of a React front-end for the user interface and a Node.js/Express back-end for handling API requests.

**Requirements:**

**Front-end (React):**
1. Create a new React application using Create React App.
2. Implement a user interface with the following features:
   - Display a list of tasks.
   - Add a new task with a title and description.
   - Edit an existing task.
   - Delete a task.
3. Use React components for different sections of the UI (e.g., TaskList, TaskForm, TaskItem).

**Back-end (Node.js/Express):**
1. Set up a Node.js/Express server.
2. Create an API with the following routes:
   - `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
   - `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task.
   - `PUT /api/tasks/:id`: Update an existing task by ID.
   - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Delete a task by ID.
3. Use an in-memory data store or a database (e.g., SQLite) to store tasks.

**General Instructions:**
1. Front-end and back-end should be in separate folders or repositories.
2. Ensure that the front-end can make API requests to the back-end.
3. Implement error handling and validation on both the front-end and back-end.
4. Use appropriate HTTP status codes for API responses (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 404).
